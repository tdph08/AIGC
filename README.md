# AI Camera Module – Smart Safety System  
*(Fire & Smoke Detection)*

## 📌 Module Overview
This repository contains the **AI Camera module** developed as part of the project:

**AI–IoT Integrated System for Smart Safety and Greenhouse Gas Monitoring**

This module focuses exclusively on the **AI Edge component**, where cameras act as **real-time intelligent sensors** to enhance safety and early warning capabilities in smart environments such as:

- Smart homes  
- Dormitories  
- Schools  
- Industrial facilities  

The AI module runs on an **edge device (laptop)** and provides detection results with a response time of **under 1 second**.

## 🧩 Integration with the Full AI–IoT System
The AI Camera module provides:
- Detection labels (fire, smoke, confidence scores)
- Bounding box coordinates
- Event triggers for early warning

These outputs are designed to be:
- Sent to a **cloud platform**
- Displayed on a **web or mobile dashboard**
- Combined with IoT sensor data in the full system
